                - White Light refracts into different colors when it passes through a prism.
                <br>
                - The same priciple works in reverse where the colours of the rainbow can be recombined into white light. 
                <br><br>
                - The theory of Colour Addition is a theory that states that the mixing of the primary colours of light can result in every visible colour. 
                <br><br>
                -This is caused when certain amounts of Low, Medium, and High frequency waves stimulate your colour sensing cells at varrying amounts.
                <br>
                <br>
                - The Red, Green, and Blue make up the primary colours of lights. 
                <br><br>
                 - We have specialized cones in our eyes that detect certain electromagnetic frequencies. There are 3 types of cones. 
                    - High frequency (Red)
                    - Medium frequency (Green)
                    - Short frequency, (Blue)
                    <br><br>
                - When two of these colours overlap and mix multiple frequencies come from the resulting light that overlaps.
                <br> 
                - These colours are known as secondary colours of light. They are Cyan Magenta Yellow.
                <br><br>
                - You can combine certain amount of all the primary colours to create every visible colour. 
                <br><br>
                - When all three primary colours of light are combined white light is created. 
                
                
                
                
                When you mix two if these colours of light you get a secondary colour of light
                
                When all three colours are mixed you get white light.
