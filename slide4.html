                - White light refracts into different colours when it passes through a prism.
                <br>
                - The same priciple works in reverse where the colours of the rainbow can be recombined into white light. 
                <br><br>
                - The Theory of Colour Addition is a theory that states that the mixing of the primary colours of light can result in every visible colour. 
                <br><br>
                -This is caused when certain amounts of Low, Medium, and High frequency waves stimulating your colour sensing cells at varrying amounts.
                <br>
                <br>
                - The Red, Green, and Blue make up the primary colours of lights. 
                <br><br>
                 - We have specialized cones in our eyes that detect certain electromagnetic frequencies. There are 3 types of cones. 
                    - High frequency (Red)
                    - Medium frequency (Green)
                    - Short frequency, (Blue)
                    <br><br>
                - When two of these colours overlap and mix multiple frequencies come from the resulting light that overlaps.
                <br> 
                - These colours are known as secondary colours of light. They are Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow.
                <br><br>
                - You can combine certain amount of all the primary colours to create every visible colour. 
                <br><br>
                - When all three primary colours of light are combined white light is created. 
                
                
                
                
                When you mix two if these colours of light you get a secondary colour of light
                
                When all three colours are mixed you get white light.

                 <h2>Traditional TV Equipment uses rows of phosphor dots that would light up when the dots recieved energy. Each set of dots had the primary colours of light, and by using different amounts each coloured light would help make a color. The surrounding dots also help cause this effect. For example, if a red dot is lit up and nearby green dots are lit up you'll see it as yellow.  </h2>
