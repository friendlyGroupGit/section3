This is one of the types of energy emitted by the sun and it’s what causes sunburns. It also contains enough energy to kill certain microorganisms which is why it's sometimes used for sanitization purposes. UV radiation also promotes production of Vitamin D in humans.

                      <h3>Radio waves are used for communication and magnetic resonance imaging. MRIs are images of the human body. The way these images are formed is by transmitting small bursts of radio waves. These energy causes the atoms of the human tissue to line up and when the radio waves are stopped the waves bounce back and the atoms return to their original state. Different tissues give back the waves at different rates. Because of that an image of the humans tissues can be formed. Radio waves are also used to transmit signals that can be received and displayed as audio or video. These waves are responsible for radio and satellite television.</h3>
